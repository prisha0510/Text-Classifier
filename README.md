# Text-Classifier
Implemented and constructed a text classifier using Naive Bayes Algorithm which works on a Large movie review data-set and predicts the sentiment of a movie review as positive or negative. Also formed word cloud of the most frequently occurring words of the positive and negative classes.
The text_classifier.py files contains the code showing the implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier, and the data sets (training and testing) are given as well, with positive and negative classes.
The path of the training and testing data as mentioned in the code will have to be changed as per the user when running this code.
